Task-1
Data visualization project using your dataset. It includes:

1) Data Loading and Cleaning
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3) Visualizations (Bar Charts, Histograms, and Other Plots)
4) Insights and Conclusion

This project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.

Task-2
perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on your Titanic dataset. This includes:

1) Loading the dataset
2) Checking for missing values and handling them
3) Exploring data distributions and summary statistics
4) Visualizing relationships between variables
5) Identifying patterns and trends

Task-3
I'll build a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

 Steps for Building the Decision Tree Classifier
1️.Load the Dataset
2️.Preprocess Data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables)
3️.Split into Training & Testing Sets
4️.Train a Decision Tree Model
5️.Evaluate Performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
6️.Visualize the Decision Tree & Feature Importance
